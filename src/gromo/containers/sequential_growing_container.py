        Must be called inside the growth lifecycle window: after

        constraints follow from that, both of which are behaviour rather than
        convention:

        - ``growth_spectra`` is ``None`` unless ``compute_optimal_updates`` was
          called with ``collect_spectra=True``, which is *not* its default.
        - ``delete_update`` nulls ``parameter_update_decrease``,
          ``eigenvalues_extension`` and ``growth_spectra`` together, so calling
          this method afterwards trips the assertion below. That assertion is a
          live guard against calling at the wrong time, not dead code.

        ``parameter_improvement`` is ``0.0`` whenever the optimal delta was not
        computed (``compute_delta=False``). That is a
        structural zero meaning "no natural-gradient step was computed", *not*
        a measurement that such a step would have bought nothing. In that case
        ``update_value`` is exactly the new neurons' first-order improvement.

        ``growth_spectra`` holds the raw tensors recorded at growth time
        (``matrix_s``, ``matrix_e``, ``extension``, ``delta``), not scalar
        summaries. Callers wanting summaries can apply
        :func:`gromo.utils.tools.spectrum_summary` themselves.
